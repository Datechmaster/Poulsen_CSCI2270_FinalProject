//FINAL PROJECT

For my final project I'm creating a program that allows for
me to add and remove clients from a linked list. I want it to
print out all current clients and their basic information
count the number of clients, and summarize client data by going through the
list and conducting some math to generate some useful information to me.
For implementing graphs it will use a graphing algorithm to calculate the 
risk of a specific individual and their electronic devices. This can be done on
any client to find their specific risk or as a pool risk algorithm that will
generate the total average risk of the pool of clients. I've included what the menu
might look like below. This program will actually assist me with a business concept
I'm working on.


cout << “___Main Menu___” << endl;
cout << "1. Add a new Client" << endl;
cout << "2. Print client list(Names)" << endl;
cout << "3. Delete a client" << endl;
cout << "4. Count the clients" << endl;
cout << "5. Summarize client data" << endl;
cout << "6. Calculate current client pool risk" << endl;
cout << "7. Quit" << endl;
